really started studying‚Ä¶ successfully? i‚Äôd say in like 2021. thai is arguably my heritage language, as my mother is thai, but i never learned anything beyond the numbers 1-10 and how to ask where the bathroom is when i was a kid. i‚Äôve seen different definitions of how much exposure to a language is necessary as a child to consider it a heritage language, but for the sake of simplicity i‚Äôll consider myself one here.</p><p>i went to visit my family in thailand the summer after my freshman year of college with my mother, where i quickly discovered how horribly inconvenient it was to rely on one person to translate <em>everything</em> in order to talk to anyone or even buy anything as no one in my extend family spoke english and they live in a part of thailand where no one else does either. i have a good relationship with my mom, but it was annoying to feel like a kid who needs their parent to do everything for them. i also realized that my mom wasn‚Äôt going to live forever; the reason we went was for the 1 year anniversary of her dad‚Äôs passing to hold another funeral ceremony. being there, it made me think of one day having to do the same for my own mom, and how i would no longer have any way of talking to her family or navigating her homeland by myself. that reality seemed so painful so i figured i should take advantage of my mom to help me while she was still alive.</p><p>despite my revelation, i didn‚Äôt really learn anything the three months i was there and was unable to successfully build a language learning routine for myself when i got back home. even though i had taken french in high school, i didn‚Äôt really know how to study a language, especially by myself and for a language that was so much more different from my native english and with way fewer resources. i also feel like my college workload was too much at the time for me to want to spend my precious free time doing even more studying. it wasn‚Äôt until after i had graduated and found a job that i decided to take another stab at trying to learn thai in <strong>late 2021</strong>.</p><h3>how i study thai</h3><p>i honestly feel like a big part of my success in actually getting anywhere with learning thai this time around, beyond the increased free time and mental stamina afforded to me by graduating university, were the resources that had been published since the last time i had tried and given up. the first resource that really changed the game for me was the book <strong>read thai in 10 days</strong> by <em>arthit juyaso</em>. i personally am anti-romanization when it comes to learning a language, since other languages have sounds that don‚Äôt exist in your own so you can‚Äôt really capture the new sounds accurately in your own writing system. also in the case of thai there is no standard romanization system so when you read romanized thai you can‚Äôt be sure if it‚Äôs using british english or american english vowels, if vowel length has been taken into account or not, which of the five tones it is, and all this other bullshit that could be avoided had you just taken the time to learn the language‚Äôs script. for these reasons i really wanted to start with learning the writing system but i had never been successful before. there are 44 consonant characters, each of which have one of three ‚Äúclasses‚Äù, that combine with one of 32 vowels, possibly one of four tone marks, and possibly another consonant at the end to determine the tone of the word. so as you can imagine it‚Äôs a massive pain in the ass to learn as it‚Äôs not as simple as associating a letter with a sound. i found that the way this book breaks up the characters and gradually introduces them alongside the ideas of consonant class, vowel length, live vs dead endings, and tones made everything click for me. while i didn‚Äôt finish the book in 10 days (it took me 20, which i found was a much more manageable pace), i did finish it feeling like i had a good enough grasp of the writing system to be able to iron out the kinks through just reading more and using thai script on my anki cards.</p><p>the second resource i found instrumental in getting started learning thai was the youtube channel <strong>comprehensible thai</strong>. i felt like before i didn‚Äôt really have any resources for listening practice aimed towards beginners that wasn‚Äôt just, like, example dialogues of tourists ordering pad thai or something. but this channel that started in 2020 i think had hundreds of hours of graded listening material on so many fun and interesting topics, all for free and is still releasing new content as of writing this, that i felt like i hit gold. i don‚Äôt follow the ALG (Automatic Language Growth) method personally, where you‚Äôre supposed to only watch the ALG content and not use traditional studying methods alongside it as a full course is suppose to take you from not understanding anything to beginning to understand native level content. i believe the aim is to basically replicate the first five or so years of a child‚Äôs language development so you have the skills to keep learning in whatever direction you want to, but can do so within your target language, just like you did with your native language as a child. but tbh i feel like my adhd prevents me from only sitting and watching videos without any sort of interaction. in the beginning i did watch the channel for the recommended 2+ hours a day, but i also went through other beginner textbooks and courses as well as keep up with my anki cards.</p><p>i still watch comprehensible thai, although i use it more for more passive listening practice while i wash my dishes and stuff like that. right now i‚Äôm going through the intermediate 1 playlist, which currently has over 700 30+ minute videos and is still getting tons of regular updates so at the rate i‚Äôm going i‚Äôll probably be using it until the heat death of the universe. i do a lot of <em>sentence mining</em> these days. for a long time i mainly sentence mined vlogs and cooking videos on youtube, although i‚Äôve been doing more shows and more complicated youtube content like history, interviews, and science now. there aren‚Äôt that many that have thai soft subs, but i do mine pretty intensely (basically any i+1 sentence i come across) so sometimes it takes me ages to get through a single show. <s>i don‚Äôt really practice reading much because quite frankly i a) have not come across enough content that interests me that is at my level, and b) i have very little need to read thai beyond signs and menus and the occasional facebook message from my family. through reading the thai on subtitles and my anki cards alone my ability to read thai has already surpassed my mom‚Äôs ability to read english and she‚Äôs been able to survive living in america just fine for over 20 years so tbh improving my reading is kinda low on my list of priorities lol.</s> july 2025 update: after struggling to get into novels and manga translated into thai due to 1) manga using small ass and often heavily stylized font; 2) every thai publisher forcing me to use their mobile app all of which don‚Äôt allow selecting text to look up words using my phone‚Äôs native dictionary or screenshots, much lessing being able to use browser and desktop tools like yomitan or ocr; i finally discovered the world of fan translated manhwa‚Ä¶ i‚Äôll probably always be more of a manga girlie but manhwa is definitely a nice change of pace. i also feel like i‚Äôve picked up a lot of words through reading that i haven‚Äôt come across just through watching stuff, especially royal vocabulary (never thought i‚Äôd get into isekai romantasy for the language gains‚Ä¶ but here we are lol). i still haven‚Äôt really gotten into reading novels but i did learn that one of my favorite authors, keigo higashino, has a ton of novels translated into thai that haven‚Äôt been translated into english, so i might suffer through thai publishers‚Äô draconian anti-consumer restrictions just to read them üòÖ</p><p>if you want to see all the resources i‚Äôve used to study thai, you can check out <a href="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/resources/language/thai/index.html">this page</a> on my resources site. you can also find more resources i‚Äôve found on the internet <a href="https://balfiere.notion.site/0aa069f3a8be4f2fb6c527adf4b21a21?v=8d3ffe13285341dab51504742976f40b">here</a>, although i can‚Äôt vouch for the quality of every source or if they‚Äôre all still up. the media log tab has all the non-youtube media i‚Äôve sentence mined if you‚Äôre looking for tv shows and movies that have soft subtitles.</p></div></tab-content><tab-content id="japanese"><div class="content"><h3>my history with japanese</h3><p>i‚Äôve been interested in japanese media since i was a little kid, but i never really had much interest in learning japanese. to be honest i don‚Äôt particularly care about watching anime without subtitles or missing every pun or other untranslatable things in the manga i read, and it seemed like such a daunting task when i wasn‚Äôt interested in the more niche and untranslated side of japanese media. but after i studied thai for around 2 years and realized how much fun studying a language could be, and getting a bit bored of only studying thai all the time, i decided to add japanese to my language learning plate in <strong>august 2023</strong>. my interest in japanese video games had also grown since i was a child, especially in more niche series and older titles, so i figured that it would be cool to be able to play untranslated jrpgs and visual novels or read game developer interviews. i think my interest was also piqued by all the language learning tools that i was using and advice i had read since they were basically all developed for learning japanese.</p><h3>how i study japanese</h3><p>i started with learning hiragana and katakana. to be honest i was surprised by how easy it was, i think i learned them all in like five days compared to the 20 days it took me to get a similar grasp on the thai script despite there being more kana than unique thai characters. after that i started using the relatively newly published textbook <strong>tobira I: beginning japanese</strong>. since it‚Äôs pretty new there isn‚Äôt that much side content developed for it yet unlike genki, but after comparing them i liked the colorfulness and vibe of the beginning tobira book more as well as the tie-in media on their official website, so i picked it over genki. at the time no one had put up scans or a pdf of the workbooks online, so i ended up purchasing them electronically through their official US ebook retailer, maruzen. but i kinda regret it because you can only use the ebook version with their proprietary software, EDX UniText, and i hate the interface of it. i have a touchscreen laptop so i‚Äôm used to marking up pdfs in apps like one note with a stylus, but their app doesn‚Äôt recognize pen pressure or utilize the buttons on my stylus so i wasn‚Äôt able to write on the ebooks like i had intended to. i ended up just writing my answers and stuff on paper, which was fine, but the experience has stopped me from purchasing the tobira ii textbook since i don‚Äôt wanna deal with that app again and the second workbook hasn‚Äôt even been published yet. <s>i‚Äôm still deciding between whether i want to keep using the beginning tobira series but buy them physically or try the kindle version on amazon, or to switch to genki ii which is easy to find for free online.</s> july 2025 update: i ended up going through tobira ii instead of switching to genki since i found a pdf of it online‚Ä¶ i still like the format of the beginner tobira series more than genki but now that their online supplemental grammar resource has switched to being paid, i have an even even harder time recommending the series for self-learners üòë</p><p>alongside textbook learning, i also do a lot of listening practice with youtube channels aimed towards japanese students. the lack of a channel like comprehensible thai with thousands of hours of free listening material for language learners is a little disappointing, but i think the only other language with a similar project is spanish (by dreaming spanish, who was in turn inspired by the ALG method for learning thai) so maybe i‚Äôm just spoiled lol. at least there‚Äôs wayyyyy more graded readers and grammar resources compared to thai, and since i have a stronger interest in being able to read japanese i guess i should feel lucky.</p><p>i use the <strong>kodansha kanji learner‚Äôs course</strong> alongside <strong>ringotan</strong> to study kanji. so far i‚Äôve gone through over <s>500</s> 1000 kanji, although i certainly wouldn‚Äôt say i ‚Äúknow‚Äù all of them yet. i think it takes awhile to fully internalize them after you get introduced to them. in addition to ringotan, i add a card for each kanji individually plus some cards for common words using that kanji to my <strong>anki</strong> deck. when i started studying thai i realized that i don‚Äôt like following premade decks, but i feel like when you‚Äôre a beginner making all your own cards for common words is a waste of time. so what i did when i started with japanese was download a bunch of the popular decks, like the core 2.3k and tango decks, put them under a main deck called ‚Äúresources‚Äù, and reformat all of them to be of the same note type. that way when i need a card for a word i want to learn, i can just search for cards that already have it as their target word and copy it to my japanese deck. <s>because of this i haven‚Äôt had much of a need to start sentence mining my own cards yet, as i‚Äôm still mostly going through N4 level vocabulary.</s> july 2025 update: i think i‚Äôve learned most N4 vocab (how do ppl even estimate how many words they know‚Ä¶ anki says i have almost 5k cards in my japanese deck but that includes phrases and collocations so i sure as hell don‚Äôt feel like i know 5k words) and do way more sentence mining now. beyond example words for kanji i‚Äôm learning, i also pick words to add to my deck based on words i notice a lot in my immersion and any word that‚Äôs part of the top 10k most common words according to the JPDB frequency list. what no one elses you about sentence mining from media you actually like is that it makes reviewing anki cards way more fun since you get to see and hear your favorite characters from time to time haha</p><p>if you want to see the resources i‚Äôve used to study japanese, check out <a href="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/resources/language/japanese/index.html">this page</a> on my resources site. there are a ton of great getting started guides to learning japanese and resource masterposts out there (and i‚Äôll add links to my favorite ones eventually) made by people who have actually been successful learning japanese, so i‚Äôll mainly be focusing on adding the sites and resources i personally end up using. sort of like a record of my journey i think. honestly i think i just felt weird about having a page for thai learning resources and not one for japanese since i‚Äôm also studying it, so i made my own resource list even though i‚Äôm very much a beginner lol.</p></div></tab-content><tab-content id="media-log"><div class="content"><p>like 80% of my language learning time consists of watching youtube but on the rare occasion i feel up to tackling

study, why i‚Äôm interested in them, my experiences so far, or whatever other random thoughts i have about this hobby of mine. i think language learning is a fun, challenging but rewarding, and worthwhile endeavour no matter what level of mastery you achieve or are even interested in striving towards. i also love feeling like i‚Äôm doing something ‚Äòproductive‚Äô with my free time, even when i‚Äôm just watching tv in my target language. while i hate the idea that people need to spend their free time productively, i also feel like a lot of people spend too much time just passively consuming content which rots your brain imo, instead of having any creative or skill based hobbies that build character or expand your worldview. i think studying a language is a great fit for those of us who love consuming media since once you get to an intermediate level you really can learn a lot by just reading or watching native content. despite my waxing philosophical, i haven‚Äôt been studying that long and i study pretty casually so i haven‚Äôt achieved anything remarkable. i also feel like a lot of language learners on the internet are either pretentious or fake so i‚Äôve sort of avoided language learning communities online, but i‚Äôve really liked reading the language pages and blogs of other people here on neocities so i thought i‚Äôd share my journey too.</p></div></tab-content></tab-container></div></body><script>const
