omg i didn’t even realize that was supposed to be him in the opening shot of the trailer, damn everyone’s getting recast ok. why does he look like some generic forgettable mid story level boss and not basically the only character in the entire series to get a sliver of a redemption arc</li><li>everybody congratulate majima on overcoming his cold</li><li>love that kanda looks exactly the same, can’t wait for his 4k backshots with kiryu scene 💖</li><li>can’t place my finger on what it is exactly but mine looks… babygirl-ified somehow</li><li>why did they change the dub to use “san” here when you can clearly hear majima calling him kiryu-chan… line still goes hard tho</li></ul><p class="gallery"><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20250924yk3_03.jpg" /></p><ul><li>i love that andre still says kiryu’s name the same way as the original</li><li>the new “ryukyu style” looks pretty fun, excited to have some more weapon-based combat (esp w tonfas). hopefully it’s better balanced than what pirates gave us</li><li>the direct mentions that “some scenes have been changed drastically” with a screenshot of the helicopter/millennium tower scene; now obviously that scene specifically needs to be rewritten to match the current canon but since andre is also alive, will the end scene also be rewritten? really… don’t know if i like the possibility of mine surviving. i mean on one hand i would love to see him alive and well but on the other hand i feel like rgg has really written themselves into a corner with all the death retcons. like andre surviving but mine not surviving makes no sense, but also mine surviving would retroactively make 4-6’s plots make less sense knowing mine was alive, but for some reason not daigo’s sugar daddy, helping him consolidate his power over the tojo. honestly andre’s death retcon didn’t really bother me in 8, but if we’re going back to revisit and rewrite old games, those changes will likely need to be addressed, which just creates more inconsistencies, and the gap between the original timeline and the post-0 timeline just keeps getting bigger…</li></ul><figure class="large"><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20250924yk3_05.jpg" alt="kiryu… peepaw go home and take care of ur kids…" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">kiryu… peepaw go home and take care of ur kids…</figcaption></figure><figure class="large"><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20250924yk3_06.jpg" alt="not only are we getting an extended Dad Simulator mode, all the kids are getting their own substory 🥹🥹🥹 i use to pray for times like these 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">not only are we getting an extended Dad Simulator mode, all the kids are getting their own substory 🥹🥹🥹 i use to pray for times like these 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹</figcaption></figure><figure class="large"><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20250924yk3_07.jpg" /> <img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20250924yk3_09.jpg" /><figcaption>kiryu kazuma has been named chairman of lesbians (and gondawara ig). the preorder bonuses are killing me saeko looks soooo cute while majima looks like a kid on a field trip lmao</figcaption></figure><h2 id="dark-ties">dark ties</h2><ul><li>did ANYONE have mine gaiden on their rgg summit bingo card bc holy fuck. rgg really saw our “yakuza kiwami 3 will have a 6 hour sex scene between mine and daigo on the roof” meme and said how about a whole ass game complete w dinner and foreplay (please god (rgg studio) give us a kaito files+ sized storyline and not a majima saga sized one…)</li><li>ok but honestly out of all the antagonists in the series i think mine getting one makes the most sense bc he’s popular like nishiki and ryuji but honestly doesn’t get much screen time in 3 nor a satisfying enough buildup to his villain speech/betrayal justification imo. but what we do know of his background just has so much potential, like you’ve got his history as a finance bro, which we’ve seen throughout the series that more and more of the yakuza are like that, there for the business and it’s overtaking what people like kiryu think of as the old, “honorable” and “loyal” sort of yakuza. but mine joins not looking to make a buck but to understand how someone could be so loyal to someone else that they die to protect them. ugh the role reversal juiciness… and of course there’s so much room to see more of the tojo’s inner workings. i understand that rgg wants to take ichi’s storyline away from the tojo and the yakuza in general to fit the current world, and i honestly think such a change is both a breath of fresh air for the series and has potential to fit ichiban better as a person, but i’m glad rgg is still finding ways to feed those of us who are still enamored with the world of the tojo. on top of that i think this is the perfect opportunity to expand upon daigo’s character. for such an important character i feel like we know very little about him other than he respects kiryu and wants to protect those with nowhere to turn to but the yakuza. praying on my hands and knees we’ll see another side of him with mine</li></ul><figure class="large"><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20250924yk3_08.jpg" alt="still undecided as to whether or not middle part houndstooth jacket mine is a slay" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">still undecided as to whether or not middle part houndstooth jacket mine is a slay</figcaption></figure><ul><li>since what we’ve seen so far seems to line up with mine’s rggo story, i wonder if this canonizes other rggo stories?

    <div class="message"><p>opened my rss reader today to find <a target="_blank" href="https://dynomight.net/ketchup/">this blog post</a>, a reply to a comment the author received on a post of his about the mathematics of heritability. i hadn’t <span class="hashtag">#read</span> the original article, but after reading the comment where the reader basically suggests that the author’s mention of r.a. fisher inventing the concept of variance to study genetics is a racist/eugenics dogwhistle, i had to go read the original. and i’m just like… does it ever get tiring. to read everything, even a short blog post explaining a singular mathematical concept, and try to sniff out the author’s political affiliations and ulterior motives, assuming that if they don’t loudly proclaim their beliefs that they’re on the “other” side. i mean i’ve been there too, and is part of why i left <span class="hashtag">#social-media</span> bc i feel like a lot of the spaces i was in and even the structure of the modern day social media platform encourage that sort of behavior. but not only did i find that i got nothing out of it, that sort of paranoia felt so damaging psychologically. like self-proclaimed anarchists will be explaining how to protect urself from the surveillance state one minute then getting their followers to dogpile someone for something they thought they said in some discord four years ago…. mf YOU are the surveillance state 😭 then u just start self-censoring ur own shitposts bc some idiot might decide to read what u said in the most bad faith way possible. and it kills me that a person’s words are still subject to that type of culture war brain rot scrutiny on their own personal website. will i ever be free from this nonsense…</p></div>

    <div class="message"><p style="text-indent:0;"> <span class="hashtag">#languagelearning</span> <span class="hashtag">#played</span> <span class="hashtag">#japanese</span> </p><p>have any other language learners noticed just how much ai has infiltrated language learning spaces… i feel like i'm probably beating a dead horse here bc damn near everybody in this neighborhood of the internet doesn't agree with genAI, but i've gotten so used to others sharing my convictions that every time i wander outside this bubble i'm always shocked at how much some people use it. and not just use it — <em>trust</em> it! and not just for asking it to translate an idiom or slang not found in dictionaries here and there. i've seen people unironically suggesting others use chatgpt and other llms to:</p><ul><li>generate an entire anki deck</li><li>generate short stories to read</li><li>have written or spoken practice conversations</li><li>translate and break down entire passages (before attempting to read it themselves and only asking for help on parts they don't understand)</li><li>generate example sentences for a target word or phrase that they found in their immersion or in the wild to add to their anki deck (instead of just… adding the original native sentence they found the word in……)</li></ul><p>and the damn apps… i swear every other day i see someone advertising their new language learning app that's basically just chatgpt/claude/gemini etc w a custom prompt. now i'm not a software dev so i may be misunderstanding something but… what's the point.</p><p>really, what's the point of using llms so extensively to learn a language. it all just seems so inefficient. like after spending 15 minutes setting up yomitan or goldendict i can look up a word or phrase in multiple different dictionaries before chatgpt even loads, then if i so choose add them to my anki deck with the original context and native audio in the time it would take to prompt chatgpt for a definition. on top of that llms love making shit up so u still need to fact check it, by checking a dictionary, asking a native speaker, etc. and it's like at that point why go through the bother of generating cards in the first place? but still i see people swear up and down that the text llms produce are correct and error free. well i'm happy ur so confident in ur own ability to assess bullshit in ur target language (not that they actually can), but the beginners u keep suggesting ur methods to aren't going to know how to. and even when it is technically correct, when i've tested llms in thai to see where these people are coming from, it just fails to produce the idiomatic, slang-filled, sometimes messy but still authentic speech.</p><p>and that's really my biggest issue with all this. i always thought the whole reason to learn a new language was to understand people. humans. who make art and write stories and fight and cry and laugh together. to connect to people who may be from a different culture but who still understand our shared humanity. the joy of learning a language is gaining access to the thoughts and feelings of a whole new group of people u couldn't before, to hear their stories… why waste what precious time we have on this earth reading the words of a mere facsimile? what's the point of learning a language if most of ur time with it is a version processed by a machine and not the version of it that lives and breathes in this world? i think these people are going to be in for a rude awakening call when they try to interact with their target language outside of the english-ified slop their favorite llm feeds them and the pleasantries exchanged with the waitress at their local cafe. if these people want to hinder their own ability to understand the authentic speech of their target language in the long run then so be it, but it kills me to think that a beginner might follow their advice or download an app that's just ai in disguise without really thinking about the implications of it.</p><p>rant aside… in other news i started my first otome game in japanese, <b>ayakashi gohan</b>. i've played a couple other, shorter visual novels in japanese but this is the first otome game and first what i would personally consider "full length" (30-40+ hrs native speed) VN. i was gonna wait to post my thoughts on it until after i finished but i had the biggest jump scare playing this game that i just HAD to post about: kuroda takaya voices one of the route antagonists.</p><figure class="large"><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20250801ayakashigohan1.jpg" /><figcaption><audio controls preload="metadata"><source src="https://files.catbox.moe/7hlrqa.ogg" type="audio/ogg" /><source src="https://files.catbox.moe/ur5tdf.mp3" type="audio/mp3" /></audio><br />……くどい。俺はもう決めた。あの娘以外は考えられん<br/>Enough. I've already made up my mind.

I'll treat you gently.</figcaption></figure><p>when i say this had me utterly gagged… i would never survive an otome game bc i would walk straight into a bad ending if the villian sounded like kiryu kazuma. like i literally spent the whole route being like yeah rin what's the hold up, forget yomi and let's go already! 😅 i'm not usually a kiryu simp (daigo has my heart, sorry king) but kuroda's work in this route even had me like 😳 the rest of this post are my favorite lines of his along with my rough translations (may not be the best but i promise they weren't written by ai 💖), in case there are any other yakuza fans out there who might want these recordings for… reasons… or just to get a kick out of it.</p><figure class="large"><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20250801ayakashigohan3.jpg" /><figcaption><audio controls preload="metadata"><source src="https://files.catbox.moe/srx35z.ogg" type="audio/ogg" /><source src="https://files.catbox.moe/w0gnka.mp3" type="audio/mp3" /></audio><br />ほう……思ったより威勢がいい女だ。ますます好みだぞ<br />Ho… you're a more lively woman than I imagined.

(mild spoilers for fated memories + 1926 below) i think i liked this sequel a little more than the first game, if only for the alternative + henri route. i love when otome games that have a lot of death in them also have an "everyone lives" route afterwards, and with the alternative route in this game i liked seeing how the LIs interact with the MC when they spend a long period of time being her friend/acquaintance before trying to get with her. especially with dante and nicola, i ended up liking them way more on their alternative route vs. their original route in the first game. legit if dante ever gave lili shooting lessons in his OG route like he does in his alternative route he probably would've ended up being my fav 😪 also i loved seeing the LIs spend more time working together since it meant more time spent bullying yang instead of trying to kill him &lt;3</p><p style="clear:both;display: flex;justify-content: center;align-items: center; flex-flow: column wrap;"><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20240828p1.opti.jpg" /><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20240828p2.opti.jpg" /><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20240828p3.opti.jpg" /><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20240828p4.opti.jpg" /><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20240828p5.opti.jpg" /><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20240828p6.opti.jpg" /></p><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20240828cardigan.jpg" style="float: right; padding-left: 1em; max-width: 30%;" alt="a panel of a cardigan, partially knitted. the piece features many cables." /><p>this month i also worked a lot on my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/folklore-cardigan-4">folklore cardigan</a>. i started this in february and had it in storage for like… 5 months… but i finally decided to get it done and now i just have the back piece left. it's the first wearable i've ever knitted and i made a lot of modifications, so hopefully it comes together alright. the yarn is from a cardigan i bought at a thrift store and unraveled, and i was worried that i wouldn't have enough yarn but i think it'll be enough. i managed to thrift and unravel two more sweaters this summer, so i'm excited to get this done and start working on the projects i have in mind for them.</p></div>
