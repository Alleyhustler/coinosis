organizes and teaches you consonants, vowels, class, tone rules, exceptions, etc – i tried and failed learning to read thai a number of times but this book made it all ‘click’ for me. <a

living in thailand. the section linked above is the best resource i’ve seen for learning the phonology (sounds) of thai. explains sounds unfamiliar to english speakers such as ป, ต, and −ือ clearly and in language accessible to those unfamiliar with linguistics. i found the spectrograms to illustrate the five tones as well as the difference between ป and บ to be particularly helpful.</dd></dl></div></details></section><section><details><summary class="subheader"><h3>courses + textbooks</h3></summary><div class="mainboxescontent"><p>honestly i don’t think the textbooks available for thai are all that great since they’re typically aimed at tourists, rely on romanization, and don’t get that advanced especially compared to what’s available for more popular languages. here are the ones that i used when i was just starting out, but i don’t recommend you treat them like college textbooks and spend like sixth months going through it – just pick one and get some basic vocab and grammar down.</p><dl><dt><a href="https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=1A8DF192174153E1EF7BA8A3574CB188" target="'_blank'">Spoken World Thai</a></dt><dd>teaches basic vocabulary and grammar

with major units broken up into smaller chapters, but also has a vocab flashcard SRS system built into it. it was free through my local library; you can check if yours carries it through the link above.</dd><dt><a href="https://thai-notes.com/FSITLC/index.html" target="'_blank'">FSI Thai Language Course</a></dt><dd>website that has taken the Foreign Service Institute’s thai language course and converted it to text to make it more accessible to modern learners. there’s a lot of audio and it’s embedded right where it’s needed, you can toggle IPA transcription on or off, and is much more thorough than other courses i’ve seen. however it was made in 1970 and is definitely showing its age, plus it was designed for 8 hours a day of in-person drilling and instruction so there’s not much in the way of self study exercises.</dd></dl></div></details></section><section><details><summary class="subheader"><h3>grammar</h3></summary><div class="mainboxescontent"><dl><dt><a

more accurate results with this than <a href="https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="'_blank'">ocrmypdf</a> even though they both use the thai tesseract model… sometimes crashes when processing pdfs though so i wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/balfiere/c39feb84f9626fb895f2e921a3b9f552" target="'_blank'">a script</a> that applies the program to a folder of images and outputs

reading.</dd></dl></div></details></section></main><footer><span>that's what friends are for, right?</span></footer></div></body><script>var sidebarDetails=document.querySelectorAll("#side
