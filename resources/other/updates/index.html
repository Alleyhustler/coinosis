to make it easier to read longer pages.</p><p><strong>9/9/2025:</strong> added more links to the <a href="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/resources/language/japanese">japanese</a> language learning pages, particularly in the grammar section and recommended youtubers in the listening section. audio files, workbooks, and answer keys for tobira ii beginning japanese have been added.</p><p><strong>9/5/2025:</strong> added more links to the <a href="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/resources/other/sitebuilding">site building</a> page, including the creation of a javascript libraries section. updated dead links on the <a href="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/resources/gaming/switch">switch</a> page.</p><p><strong>7/17/2025:</strong> added more links to the <a href="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/resources/language/tools">tools</a> and <a href="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/resources/language/thai">thai</a> language learning pages. also edited the css a bit to use css grid to fix issues in some browsers.</p><p><strong>5/29/2024:</strong> added some more online tools and references to the <a href="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/resources/other/sitebuilding">website building</a> page, added goldendict to the <a href="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/resources/language/tools">language learning tools</a> page, and added a browser tools and extensions section to the <a href="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/resources/other/more">more links</a> page.</p><p><strong>5/9/2024:</strong> released the <a href="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/resources/other/sitebuilding">website building</a> page to the public. i plan on adding graphics and accessibility sections in the future.</p><p><strong>5/4/2024:</strong> layout was updated even more. now i use <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="'_blank'">eleventy</a> to generate this site. almost all of the javascript has been removed, and the mobile navigation has been modified. now this site should be navigable without javascript enabled, even on mobile.</p><p><strong>4/29/2024:</strong> replaced some divs with semantic html tags. everything should look the same just more screen reader friendly, but i still need to test it. if you’re a return visitor and things look broken please hard refresh (ctrl + f5).</p><p><strong>4/3/2024:</strong> added reading section to japanese resources and applications section to language learning tools section.</p><p><strong>3/28/2024:</strong> okay i think i have something on every page now! i still have more links i wanna add to the japanese and more links sections but this should have most of my favorite sites now 🥳</p><p><strong>3/20/2024:</strong> made the site responsive and (hopefully) mobile friendly. i wanna redo how the links are displayed eventually but it should be serviceable for now. i also added dark mode support.</p><p><strong>3/17/2024:</strong> made each section on a page collapsible, hopefully it should help navigation on longer pages like my thai resources page and (eventually) my japanese page.</p><p><strong>3/15/2024:</strong> added a landing page! for when i inevitably make a personal site, so ppl can go straight to one or the other. decided to make to make it nana themed, it took FOREVER (2 days) to code but i think it looks p cute?! i also started adding gaming links here, i should be done adding them over the next week or so.</p><p><strong>3/13/2024:</strong> my thai page is basically done at this point and i’ve put in my most used japanese resources, although i still have more i want to add. i learned that one of my favorite thai language learning sites that i hadn’t visited in awhile, aakanee, is down .·´¯`(&gt;▂&lt;)´¯`·. luckily the wayback machine seemed to have archived all the files and stuff i checked but it was a good reminder of one of my goals with this site – to archive my favorite resources and share my backups with others!</p><p><strong>3/9/2024:</strong> created this site today! i’ve been thinking about making a site like this for awhile now, to organize my favorite bookmarks related to language learning and game emulation, roms, etc and sharing it with others. after the recent loss of citra, yuzu, and tachiyomi, i decided it was finally time to make this site and share links to my own archives and backups of my favorite programs at risk of being taken down. eventually i want to add a personal page and maybe a yakuza shrine? if i can get better at coding…</p></div></section></main><footer><span>that's what friends are for, right?</span></footer></div></body><script>var sidebarDetails=document.querySelectorAll("#side details");const
